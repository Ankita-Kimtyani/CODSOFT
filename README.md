# CodSoft Internship Projects

Welcome to my CodSoft Internship repository! This repository contains the projects I worked on during my internship at CodSoft, covering machine learning applications in classification and prediction.

## Projects Included

### 1. Movie Rating Prediction
- **Description**: This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, cast, director, and audience reviews.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Model selection and training
  - Performance evaluation and visualization

### 2. Iris Classification
- **Description**: A classification model built using the famous Iris dataset to categorize flowers into three species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data analysis and visualization
  - Training a classification model (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest)
  - Evaluating model performance

### 3. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Description**: Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using historical data and machine learning techniques.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection
  - Training classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
  - Model evaluation and insights extraction

## Installation and Setup
To run the projects locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codsoft-internship.git
   cd codsoft-internship
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook files or Python scripts for each project.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank CodSoft for this opportunity to enhance my skills in machine learning and data science.
